# Island of Computability

## Countable sets

- A set S is **countably infinite** if there exists a bijective function $\mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,\ldots\} \rightarrow S$
- **Countable** if it is countably infinite _or_ finite

If $S_0, S_1, \ldots$ are countable sets then $\bigcup^{\infty}_{i=0} S_i$ is countable

- Hilbert's Hotel: a hotel with countably infinite number of rooms can accommodate countably infinitely many coachloads of countably infinite passengers each

> If $S$ is any infinite set, then $2^S$ is uncountable â€” _Cantor's diagonal argument_

## Uncountable languages

- For every alphabet $\Sigma$, there are uncountable many languages over $\Sigma$ that are not semidecidable
