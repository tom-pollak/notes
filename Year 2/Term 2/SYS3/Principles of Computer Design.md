# Principles of Computer Design

## Measuring Performance

- Response time
- Throughput
  - Transactions per unit time
- CPU time
- Wall clock time
  - Overall time taken
- Speedup
  - If execution time is faster than on program X than program Y

### Benchmarks

- Toy programs
  - Sorting
  - Matrix multiply
- Synthetic benchmarks
- Benchmark suites
	- SPEC06
	- SPLASH

#### Benchmark Evaluation

- IPC â€“ Instructions per cycle
- Instruction profile
	- Type of instructions executed
- L1 data cache misses
	- 
- Branch mispredicitons
