# Regression

## Loss functions

### Squared loss

$Loss(guess, actual) = (guess - actual)^{2}$

#### Ordinary least squares

> Find hypothesis that minimizes the squared loss

##### OLS solution using optimization

We want $\theta^{*}, \theta^{*}_{0} = \underset{\theta, \theta_{0}}{argmin} J(\theta, \theta_{0})$
