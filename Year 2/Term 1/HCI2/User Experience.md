# User Experience

> Increasing diversity of interfaces has contributed to technology becoming embedded in our lives â€” B$\varnothing$dker

- Phones
- VR, AR
- voice and motion control
- touchscreen displays

# Ubiquitous computing

## Seamless Integration

- Invisibility
- Users can switch between technologies easily
- Unobtrusive tech that fade into background until you need them

## Seamful Design

> Focus on seamless would make everything the same

E.g. wifi can be slow, suggested that instead of hiding from the users use seamful interface tho convey patchwork of wifi while highlighting signal strength

## Blended spaces

> Physical space and a digital space brought together

e.g. Computer window: window in house and collecting computer operations together
