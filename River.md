# River

- If the pot is $100, and you go all-in for $1,000,000 you should have 50% bluffs and 50% good hands
	- As if you have less than 50% bluffs they can always fold and more they always call
- Betting small can be used for a larger value range

- Earlier streets can have more bluffs as you have equity and are more likely to improve
