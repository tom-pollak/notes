# The Thing & I: Understanding the relationship between user and product

- Product “character” can vary between intendended (designer) and user
- Construct product character from features, personal standards, expectations (other similar products)
	- Can be based on situation or bad design
	- E.g. ATM designed to be highly understandable by putting receiving money into short steps
		- However can be frustrating to user that has limited time
- 1. Product features - establish character, pragmatic & hedonic attributes
- 2. Character leads to consequences: Situation specific!
	- judgement about product appeal
	- Emotional consequences (pleasure, satisfaction)
	- Behavioural consequences (increased time spent with product)
- This will always take place - even in situations with very limited information
- Stimulating product: individuals strive for personal development, while many will not need or use all features available in a software, they nevertheless wanted the functionality for future perfection of current goals or future generation of new goals
	- Features used pragmatic, features not yet used but are interesting hedonic
- Product may be hedonic: stimulation, identification, or provokes memories
	- E.g. vintage games, may buy a certain hammer (pragmatic) brand that communicates professionalism to others or a whole kit
- Product needs to communicate _identity_ e.g. home page to communicate advantageous identity
	- Borcherding and Schumacher (2002): Students who believed others hold unfavourable opinions and few social contacts presented more info about friends and family on their homepages
- ACT: Strong pragmatic weak hedonic, SELF: Strong hedonic, weak pragmatic
-   Appreciation & bond of SELF products much more stable that ACT: as prob individual change what they require is much lower than prob that behavioural goals change
- Satisfaction: outcome and expectations of a product are confirmed
- Joy: Pleased about a desirable event per se
	- Requires no expectations: the more unexpected, the more intense
- Appealing: broad, trigger positive emotional reaction
- ACT more likely to be appealing and satisfaction, SELF: joy as hedonic
- Usage modes: situation dependant, psychological states
	- Goal mode: goal fulfilment in the fore, goal has importance and determines all actions
		- Product means to an end
		- Individuals try to be effective and efficient: describe themselves as “serious” and “planning”
	- Action mode: determine goals on the fly, volatile
		- Product end in itself
		- Effectiveness & efficiency not as important
		- Individuals “playful” “spontaneous”
- Designers may better understand how people perceive and value objects
- Operationalisation and measurement of key elements
