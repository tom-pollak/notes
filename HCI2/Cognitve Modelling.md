# Cognitive Modelling

## Cognitive Models
> ##### Models: Methods of task decomposition
> - Provide esitmates of user behaviour and system response

- User interaction broken-down into atomic units (e.g. keystrokes, mouse clicks) that are measurable (e.g. no of actions total errors, accuracy)

## GOMS
> **Goals:**: end state user is trying to achieve
> - Hierarchical decomposition of tasks
> 
> **Operators:** basic actions (moving mouse)
> **Methods:** Sequences of operators or procedures for achieving a goal or sub-goal (e.g. selecting text for deletion involves moving a mouse)
> **Selection rules:** invoked when there is a choice of rules

## Vision

### Movement in periphery
- User know something's  there, will move eyes to check (especially movement)
	- But if error message in periphery 

- Eye movement **saccades** and point we stop are **fixations**

### Eye gaze
- Eye-mind assumption: amount of fixation is related to amount of processing to understand the information there
- Immediacy assumption: assign meaning in fixation

### Poor contrast in interactive systems
- Navigating reading and interacting confusing and frustrating

## Auditory
### Percieving sound

#### Localization

- Tell where the sound is coming from by the time a sound takes to reach each ear
- More accurate telling left and right than up and down
- Simulate sound in various systems
- Compensate by not being very precise with head movements and attending sound frequency'
