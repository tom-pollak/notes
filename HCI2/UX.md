# UX

## Emotion Design

Emotions can either be:

- Automatic: Rapid and dissipate quickly
- Conscious: Develop slowly and take a long time to go

> Our emotional state influences how we think and make decisions

- **Visceral:** Preconscious first impressions, triggered by initial sensory experience
  - How product looks, feels and sounds
- **Behavioural:** Relates to subconscious, automatic behaviours
  - Traditional values of usability
  - Product functions & emotions during use
- **Reflective:** How we make sense of the world and conciously reflect on our experience
  - Meaning and personal value of product

## UX Models

### Technology as Experience

> Adopt holistic view of experience

- Needs to be understood as a whole, rather than broken down into constituent parts
- Interactivity involves different people, technology, activity and contexts
- Experience shaped by what we bring and surround ourselves with

### Four threads of experience

- **Sensual**
- **Emotional**
- **Spatio-temporal:** Space and time, no two experiences are identical
- **Compositional:** Narrative structure of experience, integrity/coherence

### Six sense-making processes

- **Anticipating**
- **Connecting:** Immediate sense of situation
- **Interpreting:** Develop narrative relating to prior knowledge
- **Reflecting:** Making judgements about experience both during and after
- **Appropriating:** Interweaving experience into life
- **Recounting:** Telling to others, choosing what to share

## Alternative Models

### Hedonic & Pragmatic Model

- **Pragmatic:** Instrumental, task-oriented qualities primarily related to behavioural goals
  - Useful, controllable
- **Hedonic:** Non-instrumental, self-oriented qualities that relate to pleasure of experience
  - Exciting, impressive, presentable
