# In the Wild

## External Cognition

- Create external representations to aid memory
  - notes to remember shopping
  - calendar

## Distributed Cognition

- Number of people with range of technologies and devices, trying to achieve a goal
  - NHS choose and book: allows patient to make hospital appointment with consultant of choice at hospital of choice

> Propagation of knowledge between individuals

Door automatically closing itself: person who opened door does not have to think about closing it as architect already decided the door should close automatically

## Activity Theory

## Situated Action

>  Action and planning are both situated in context of a flow socially
>  - As opposed to planning everything - people improvise, non-deterministic, cannot be reproduced

- Nothing can be understood without first understanding its context
- Human procedures are not replicable

<br>
- We do not follow plans most of the time
- Our actions are situated i.e., we do our best at each step, but things do not always work according to plan

## Observation

### Quick and Dirty

- Observe people using technology and see what problems they are having

### Level of Observer Involvement

- Observe as an outsider,
  - Don't give help or ask what they are having trouble with
  - e.g. observe how long it takes to use a ticket machine, noting their age and gender

<br>

- Observers who also participate
  - May pose as staff, offering customers special offers

<br>

- Partial participant/ complete participant
  - Observer becomes part of accomapny for a while
