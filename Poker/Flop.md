# Flop

![[flop-options.jpg]]

- IP bet sizes of 33 & 66%
- OOP bet size 50%

## IP offensive

- Uncapped range
- High c-bet frequency
- V generally check to us

### single raised pot

![[ip-offense-formations-srp.jpg]]

- We fare worse against SB as have a narrower range than BB
- Should be c-betting 2/3 ~25% of the time
- Should be checking 25% of the time against BB from EP & MP and 40% in LP
- Should be checking 40% of the time vs SB

#### LP vs SB

- LP has under 50% equity and should check back 50% of flops
  - Despite SB range being capped: no AA AK KK, QQ JJ 50% of the time
- SB should lead 13% of the time!

### 3-Bet pot

![[ip-offense-formations-3b.jpg]]

#### IP vs EP

- Largest advantage, polarized range of top hands and bluffs (KTs 97s 86s A5s A4s)
- 57% equity, EQR 118%
- Bet 2/3 majority of the flops (57%)

#### Other Formations

- Bet 75% of range, slightly preferring smaller sizing
- Both have wide opening ranges with linear 3-bet ranges

## OOP offensive

- Uncapped range
- C-bet frequency varies by texture

### Single raised pots

- Check at least 40% – even from best position (EP vs MP/LP)
- Prefers small bet for most of the range
- **Very** rare check-raise (2-5%)
- Equity advantage high, so check-fold 13-23% of range

![[oop-offense-formations-srp.jpg]]

- Benefit more playing LP than earlier position
- When facing MP, slightly under-realize equity – bet 50% of our range
- When facing LP, realize our equity and bet 60% regardless of whether we open from EP or MP

#### Bet Sizes

- MP v LP – bet larger 16% of our range 2.75:1
  - Have more coverage and able to polarize across more board textures
- EP v LP – bet 9% of our range 5:1

#### SB v BB

- Only bet 36% of the time, preferring small sizes 2:1
- We are far too wide and have lots of misses
  - While we are uncapped and have nut coverage, we have a lot of air
  - Hard to bet a large portion of our range without becoming bluff-heavy
- 5% check-raise – while most strong hands will lead, need some stronger hands to protect our checking range

### 3-Bet Pots

#### Polarized Ranges

![[3b-polarized-oop.jpg]]

- High equity, EV% & EQR
- C-bet 90% of the time with larger sizing 2:1

#### Linear Ranges

![[3b-linear-oop.jpg]]

- Lower success metrics, but still great position
- C-bet less often – 60%, with smaller sizing 1.5:1
- 5% check-raise, 20% check-call, 15% check-fold


## IP Defense

- Capped range
- V has range advantage
- Often face a c-bet from V
- Will be at a disadvantage in equity, but will often over-realize our equity from our position
- Only 50% pot as we have a range disadvantage and won't have many aggressive options available to us

### Single-Raised Pots

![[ip-defense-formations-srp.jpg]]


#### EP v EP – Uncapped flatting range

![[srp-vs-ep-formation-data.jpg]]

- 77+ JTs+ KQo+ against EP open
	- Deviate from baseline raising strategy for deception against capable players
	- Retain more equity, earn a higher EV and realize equity more efficiently with uncapped range
	- V will assume we are capped and play the IP v EP range
- Opponent should only bet 9% of the time, which is unlikely
	- Bet too much when they think they are facing an uncapped range
	- Significantly too much when we are uncapped
- We continue at 70% frequency, mainly through calls

#### EP v IP

- Opponent should bet 33% of the time
- Call 54%, Raise 11% and fold bottom 35% of our range
- For checking, we should be 50% of the time

#### MP/LP Opens

![[srp-ip-defense-formations-linear.jpg]]

- Wider, linear range
- V should c-bet 50%
	- Continue with 2/3 of hands
	- Raise ~10% with a polarized range
- Should open after a check with little less than half the range
