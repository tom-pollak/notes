# Development Lifecycles

## Waterfall

## Spiral

![[Spiral-development.png]]

- Incremental Development with multiple prototypes

1. Determine objectives
2. Identify and resolve risks
3. Development and Test
4. Plan the next iteration

# Development Methods

## Plan-driven

> Overall project “roadmap”

- Risk of excessive focus on bureaucracy
- Requires extensive documentation
  - Communication
  - Process improvement

### RUP

> Rational Unified Process

- Model driven development
- Incremental approach to development

**Storytelling**

- Based on reasonable set of user stories
- Developers refine stories to an OOP design
  - In each iteration, additional information added to designs
- Written from a user's perspective
- Stories split into “normal” and “exceptional” cases

## Agile

- Short iteration cycles
  - Incremental delivery
  - Rapid feedback
- Low documentation overheads
- Inclusive relationship with customer

### Manifesto

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

### Principles

> Top priority: Satisfy customer through **early and continuous delivery** of valuable software

- Welcome changing requirements
- Deliver working software frequently
- Business and developers must work together
- Build projects around motivated individuals
- Promote sustainable development
- Face-to-face conversation
- Working software primary measure of progress
- Best work emerge from self-organizing teams
- Teams should regularly reflect on how to become more effective

### OODA Loop

> Obseve-Orient-Decide-Act

### Extreme Programming

(XP)

- Pair programming
- TDD
- Continuous Integration
- Small releases
- Simple design
- Collective code ownership
- Design improvement (refactoring)

## Scrum

> Development divided into sprints
>
> - Short: one week to one month

- Each sprint preceded by planning a meeting
- Daily activities start with a “scrum”
  - Each person reports:
    - What they've done in the last day
    - What's happening today
    - What risks/ problems they anticipate

### Team Scrums

- Each daily scrum leads to “scrum of scrums”
  - Check overlap and integration
- After each sprint, there's a scrum review
