> Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

# Supervised Learning

> Train machine using data which is well labelled

1. Predictive model construction
2. PM tested using new data
3. PM used for classifying future or unknown cases

# Unsupervised Learning

> Classification not provided
>
> - Develop classification labels automatically

> Seek groups of **clusters**: Data that has similarities that can be characterized

## K-Means Clustering

- Number of clusters need to be known
- Maintains _k cluster means_ â€” centres
- Objects assigned to the closest centre then means updated
- Terminates when the centres do not change or fixed number of iterations has been conducted

Euclidean distance formula: $dist((x, y), (a, b)) = \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}$
