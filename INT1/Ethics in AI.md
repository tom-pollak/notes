# Ethics in AI

- Bias: Typically insidious: creeps in everywhere
- Job Losses: Countered by argument that says that it also introduces new jobs creating new tech
	- But the working class people are not benefited by this
- “Terminator” Issue: How much control should be given to AI systems?
	- Biased systems even worse
	- Minimise human suffering, make paperclips
	- Isaac Asimov 3 laws & 4th zero law are actually quite a good foundation
- Lack of Accountability: Robot harms a human, who is to blame?
	- Self-driving cars
- Transparency: A-Level prediction algorithm, weren't specified how it works
	- Without transparency, trust is impossible
- Should Robots have rights?
	- If we have strong AI, they are thinking beings and deserve to be treated as such
	- Argue against strong AI specifically so they can exploit this workforce for monetary gain
- Privacy
- AI in politics: Cambridge Analytica, nudge politics
- AI in military
- Cyborgs
- Carbon impact from training AI systems
- Relying too heavily on AI systems
- AGI: AI can perform well at multiple distinct tasks
- Guaranteeing safety: guarantee properties of AI systems, bounds
