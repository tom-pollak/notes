# Game Theory

> Two or more agents interacting with same enviourment
> - We assume we have a rational opponent who wants to maximize their utility

- Specifically with no communication
  - Aligns well with real games

- Most games can be extended to more players, but complexity increases exponentially

## Utility

### Zero-sum games

> Define winning and losing a game through utility

e.g., poker quantify utility through how much money you leave with compared to how much you arrive with

- This is a zero-sum game

### General-Sum game

- Situations where all players can gain/lose: e.g., prisoner's dilemma


### Notation

- Represent utility in form (P1, P2), for utility of players
- In a zero-sum game, these will be (-4, 4)
	- We can often emit second player, reducing down to -4
